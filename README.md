Fire Deck
========

What is it?
-----------
Fire Deck [firedeck.tk] is a free, open-source Pear Deck alternative.

Why did you make it?
--------------------
I made it because I wanted to learn how to use Firebase with more complexity, and I tackled Pear Deck as an easy project.

What libraries did you use?
---------------------------
I used [jQuery](http://jquery.com), [Firebase](http://firebase.com/), [Quill](http://quilljs.com/), [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com), [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/), and [Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com/)
